A _derivation_ is an instruction that Nix uses to [_realise_][realisation] a Nix package.
They're created using a special `derivation` function in the [Nix language](#nix-language).
They can depend on any number of other derivations and produce one or more final [outputs](#outputs).
A derivation and all of the dependencies required to build it&mdash;direct dependencies, and all dependencies of those dependencies, etc&mdash;is called a [closure].

## Derivation outputs \{#outputs}

The most common outputs:

- `out`, the most generic one
- `lib`, for library outputs
- `dev`, general development resources such as header files
- `man`, for manual pages

A derivation and all of the dependencies required to build it&mdash;direct dependencies, and all dependencies of those dependencies, etc&mdash;is called a _package closure_.

<Admonition success title="Mental model">
  You may find it helpful to think of a derivation as the *plan* or *blueprint*
  for a Nix package.

## Derivations in the Nix language \{#nix-language}

In the [Nix language][lang], derivations are created using the [`derivation`][func] function.
Here's the type signature for `derivation` expressed as a [Haskell]-ish signature:[^1]

```haskell title="Derivation type signature" disableClipboard
derivation ::
    { system   : String
    , name     : String
    , builder  : Path | Derivation
    , ?args    : [String]
    , ?outputs : [String]
    } -> Derivation
```

Here's an example derivation:

```nix title="Example derivation"
derivation {
  # A name for the derivation (whatever you choose)
  name = "hello-text";
  # The system realising the derivation
  system = "x86_64-linux";
  # The program realising the derivation
  builder = "bash";
  # Arguments passed to the builder program
  args = ["-c" "mkdir $out && echo Hello world > $out/hello.txt"]
};
```

And that's it!
The `derivation` function takes only these arguments.
But derivations can be far less straightforward, because the scripting logic that you pass via `args` can be arbitrarily complex.

### String interpolation

If Nix sees this string...

```nix title="my-file.nix"
{
  buildPhase = ''
    mv ${pkgs.website}/favicon.ico
  '';
}
```

The string output of a derivation is always a [Nix store path][store]

## Derivation outputs

## Realisation

### Special variables

There are two special variables to be aware of when writing derivations:

- `$out` represents the root of the directory structure for build output.
- `$src` represents the build sources.

## The standard environment \{#stdenv}

Most derivations in the Nix ecosystem are based on the [`mkDerivation`][mk] function from the [standard environment][stdenv].

While you _can_ create derivations using the raw `derivation` function, it's far more common to use a wrapper function around it.
Perhaps the most commonly used wrapper function is [`stdenv.mkDerivation`][mk].
Arguments:

- The `name` of the package. If you specify `pname` and `version` instead, the `name` ends up `${pname}-${version}`.

## Other derivation functions

Outside of `stdenv.mkDerivation`, there are many custom derivation wrappers for specific languages, frameworks, and more (and many of those actually wrap `stdenv.mkDerivation`).
Some examples:

- [`buildGoModule`][buildgomodule] for [Go]
- [`buildRustPackage`][buildrustpackage] for [Rust]
- [`buildPythonApplication`][buildpythonapplication] for [Python]

You're likely to encounter many more in the Nix ecosystem.
And you're always free to create your own derivation functions and even wrap helper functions like `buildPythonApplication`.
