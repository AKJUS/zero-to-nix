The _Nix ecosystem_ is a software ecosystem that has the [Nix] package manager and [language] at its core but also includes a vast network of related tools and systems built on top of Nix.
On the official side, the Nix ecosystem includes [NixOS], [NixOps], [Hydra], [Home Manager][hm], and [other projects][others].
On the unofficial side, the Nix ecosystem includes everything from [language] libraries and helpers to [package repositories][packages] to developer tools and far beyond.

Depending on your perspective, Nix-inspired projects like [GNU Guix][guix] and projects that share Nix's commitment to principles like [reproducibility] and [declarative configuration][declarative] may also fall under the Nix ecosystem umbrella.

Regardless of where you draw the lines, getting into Nix can bring vast regions of the software industry into your reach.
