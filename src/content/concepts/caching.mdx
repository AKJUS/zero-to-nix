By default, Nix uses _caching_ to make [building packages][packages] faster and more efficient.
This in turn makes other Nix operations that involve building packages, like creating [development environments][dev] and standing up [NixOS] environments, faster and more efficient as well.

## Building vs. caching

Whenever Nix builds a [package][packages] by [realising] the package's [derivation], it needs to realise the entire [closure] of the derivation, which means that it needs to realise all of the derivations required to build the package's derivation, plus the derivations required to build those derivations, and so on.
Some packages have tiny closures (dependency trees) while others have massive closures involving thousands of derivations, which makes build efficiency a primary concern in Nix.

Here's what Nix does whenever it realises a derivation:

1. It computes a hash for the derivation and, using that hash, a [Nix store path][store-paths] of this form (for a hypothetical Git package):

   <NixStorePath pkg="git-2.37.0" hash="f8f72p3xxr20k111mpg4kk93i4cp74qb" />

1. With a store path in hand, Nix determines whether the derivation has already been built.
   First, Nix checks the configured [Nix store][store] to see if the path `/nix/store/f8f72p3xxr20k111mpg4kk93i4cp74qb/git-2.37.0` already exists.
   If so, it uses that rather than building it.
   If not...

1. It checks if the store path exists in a configured [binary cache](#binary-caches).

1. If the store path exists neither in a configured [Nix store][store] nor in a configured [binary cache](#binary-caches), Nix builds the derivation from scratch, recursively following all of the steps in this list, using already-realised packages whenever possible and building only what is necessary.

<Admonition success title="Nix without caching">
  Without caching, [realisation][realising] would involve always building
  everything from scratch every single time, which would make Nix a much less
  efficient&mdash;and thereby much less compelling!&mdash;package manager and
  build tool.
</Admonition>

## Binary caches

In addition to the local [Nix store][store], you can also cache Nix artifacts using remote Nix stores called _binary caches_ that serve pre-built binaries via HTTP.
For the most part, binary caches work just like the Nix store, enabling Nix to quickly determine whether something has already been built on the basis of a derivation's Nix store path.

By default, Nix uses [cache.nixos.org][cache] as a binary cache, which is open to all and populated by continuous integration systems.
In addition to this community cache, you can also [run your own][run] or use a third-party binary cache service like [Cachix].
