_Incremental builds_ are build processes that don't need to build the entire dependency tree of a software artifact every time because they use mechanisms like intelligent [caching] to avoid rebuilding artifacts that are already available.
Nix is one of several available build systems that offers incremental builds.

## How Nix provides incremental builds \{#how}

Nix is one of several build systems that offers incremental builds for [Nix packages][packages] by storing all build results in the [Nix store][store].

Whenever Nix builds a [package][packages], it builds the entire [closure], or dependency tree, of that package.

<NixStorePath pkg="git-2.27.3" />

The hash portion enables Nix to "know" what doesn't need to be built.
If the package `super-important-dependency` is necessary to build the package `final-production-artifact`, Nix can inspect the [derivation] for `super-important-dependency` and calculate a hash for that dependency and, thus, a Nix store path for it, something like this:

<NixStorePath
  pkg="super-important-dependency"
  hash="m7hsk1m4jkwy6pnns5gpn1kss22raan4"
  valueOnly
/>

With that information in hand, Nix can then check to see if one of these places already has the artifact:

- The local [Nix store][store]
- One of your configured [binary caches][binary] (if any)

Nix builds a given derivation only if it fails to discover a realised artifact in one of these places.
This can make a huge difference when building large [closures][closure].

## Consequences of incremental builds in Nix \{#consequences}

[Packages] are in many ways the central organizing artifact in Nix.
[Nix development environments][env] make packages available in a hermetically sealed way, [NixOS] is built with Nix packages as its basis, and so on.
What that means is that incremental builds in Nix make pretty much everything associated with Nix much faster and less resource intensive.
