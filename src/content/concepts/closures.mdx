In Nix, a [package]'s _closure_ encapsulates all of the packages required to [build or run](#build-vs-run) it (as well as the packages required to build those packages, and so on).
A package can have zero packages in its closure, because no other packages are required to build it, or it can have many.
Whenever you build a package, Nix always [realises] its entire closure in a [sandboxed] environment.

## Build-time and runtime closures \{#build-vs-run}

Nix closures come in two different types:

- _Build-time_ closures include everything necessary to build the package.
- _Runtime_ closures include everything necessary to run the package.

To give an example, let's say that you're using Nix to build [Firefox] because you want to install and run it on your machine.
The build-time closure for Firefox would include [GCC] because you can't build Firefox without it.
The runtime closure, however, would not include GCC&mdash;Firefox has already been built!&mdash;but it would include [GTK], which Firefox needs for its user interface.

When you see mentions of Nix closures in Nix documentation and other places, runtime closures are usually what's meant.

## Closure bloat

If you include things that a package doesn't need in its closure, you end up with a waste of resources&mdash;time, disk space, and network bandwidth&mdash;known as _closure bloat_.
Nix always [realises] whatever you tell it to and doesn't have any built-in mechanisms to prevent closure bloat.
The solution to closure bloat is vigilance&mdash;you should always vet the [derivations] you create to ensure that every package you include in a derivation is truly required to build or run the desired package.
