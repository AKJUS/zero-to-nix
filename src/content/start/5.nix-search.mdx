One great thing about Nix is that there are *tons* of [packages] available in the [Nix ecosystem][ecosystem] that you can use in [Nix development environments][env], in your [NixOS][nixos] installations, and more.
While [Nixpkgs] is by far the largest Nix package collection&mdash;over 100,000 packages and counting :sunglasses:&mdash;any [Nix flake][flakes] can provide package [outputs].

But navigating all of this plenty can be tricky, so in this guide we'll learn how to search for packages in Nixpkgs using the [`nix search`][nix-search] command and using the web application at [search.nixos.org][search].
Then we'll learn how to explore packages in [other flakes](#nix-flake-show).

## The `nix search` command \{#nix-search-command}

The [Nix CLI][nix] has a `search` command that you can use to search the packages in a flake based on a search term.
Let's start by searching [Nixpkgs], which is where we're mostly likely to find packages we want.
This command will tell us if [cargo] is available in [Nixpkgs]:

```shell
nix search "https://flakehub.com/f/NixOS/nixpkgs/*" cargo
```

In this command, the `nixpkgs` [flake reference][flake-ref] is shorthand for `github:NixOS/nixpkgs`.

<Admonition warning title="This could take a while" id="nix-search">
  The first time you run `nix search`, the Nix CLI needs to download the full
  Nix code contents of [Nixpkgs]&mdash;or whichever flake you're
  searching&mdash;and then cache it. Future `nix search` runs for Nixpkgs should
  be much speedier. Furthermore, Nixpkgs is the largest flake in existence and
  running `nix search` on other flakes should be much faster in general.
</Admonition>

This brings up many results of the form `legacyPackages.{system}.{package}`, the first of which should look like this on an Apple Silicon (`aarch64-darwin`) system:

```shell
* legacyPackages.aarch64-darwin.cargo (1.65.0)
  Downloads your Rust project's dependencies and builds your project
```

The system attribute [varies](#system-specificity) on other platforms (you may see `x86_64-linux` or something else).
After that first result, you should see many others, including packages like [`cargo-about`][cargo-about] and [`cargo-audit`][cargo-audit].

<Admonition
  warning
  title="`legacyPackages` isn't legacy software"
  id="legacy-packages"
>
  The `legacyPackages` attribute that you see in the search output is a bit
  misleading. The [packages] prefaced with that aren't "legacy" packages;
  instead, [Nixpkgs] uses a special `legacyPackages` attribute to output
  packages instead of the usual `packages` output for reasons laid out
  [here][legacy-comment].
</Admonition>

You can also output search results as JSON using the `--json` flag:

```shell
nix search nixpkgs cargo --json
```

This can be useful if you want to parse the output using a tool like [jq].

## search.nixos.org \{#web}

The web interface at [search.nixos.org][search] has a few advantages over the [`nix search`](#nix-search-command) command:

- It enables you to select a release channel for [Nixpkgs], such as [22.11] and [unstable]
- It enables you to search across a range of [public flakes][public-flakes] beyond Nixpkgs (those flakes are listed [here][flakes-list])

## Exploring a flake with the `nix flake show` command \{#nix-flake-show}

As an example, let's explore a popular flake for the [Wayland] window system protocol.

```shell
nix flake show "github:nix-community/nixpkgs-wayland"
```

<Admonition warning title="This could take a while" id="nix-search">
  The first time you run `nix flake show`, the Nix CLI needs to download the
  full contents of [`nixpkgs-wayland`][nixpkgs-wayland]&mdash;or whichever flake
  you're running `nix flake show` on&mdash;and then cache it. Future `nix flake
  show` runs for the same [flake reference][flake-ref] should be much speedier.
</Admonition>

<Admonition
  info
  title="When to use `nix search` vs. `nix flake show`"
  id="which-search-command"
>
  Should you use `nix flake show` or `nix search`? A good rule of thumb is to
  always use `nix search` with Nixpkgs and to initially use `nix flake show`
  with other flakes. If the package outputs for `nix flake show` are big enough
  to be tricky to navigate, use `nix search` for that flake instead.
</Admonition>

## System specificity

One thing you'll notice about the search output for `nix search`, [search.nixos.org][search], and `nix flake show` is that all the packages listed in the query results are for your current system (`x86_64-linux` for an AMD/Intel Linux system, `aarch64-darwin` for an Apple Silicon system, and so on).
That's because Nix works in a fundamentally [system-specific] way.
The `cargo` package on a Linux machine is considered a _different package_ from `cargo` on a non-Linux system.
