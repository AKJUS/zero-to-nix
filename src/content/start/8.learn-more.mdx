This completes your Zero to Nix journey!
You just accomplished a great deal:

- You [installed Nix][install] on your machine
- You ran some [programs] using Nix
- You explored some [Nix development environments][env]
- You [searched] for packages in [Nixpkgs] and elsewhere in the Nix [ecosystem]
- You built some [Nix packages][pkg]

And that's just to name a few.
We're thrilled that you've taken the time and made the effort.
But we hope that your Nix journey continues onward.
This guide suggests some areas beyond the scope of the quick start where you can apply your newly won Nix knowledge.

## Build container images \{#containers}

[Nix] can build [packages] for many things, from standard tools like [curl] and [Git] to [Vim] plugins to [Visual Studio Code][code] extensions to web services that you write in your preferred language and far beyond.
We've covered a few of these package types here in the [quick start][start].
Another powerful Nix feature is that you can use it to build [OCI]-compliant container images and thereby replace tools like [Docker] and [Podman] (at least when it comes to building images).

## Use NixOS as your operating system \{#nixos}

[NixOS] is a [Linux] distribution built on Nix and its core principles, such as [reproducibility] and [declarative configuration][declarative].

## Configure your home environment \{#home-environment}

[Home Manager][home] is a plugin-based tool built on Nix that you can use to configure a wide range of tools in your home environment, including [Vim], [tmux], [Visual Studio Code][code], [Git], [gpg], and shells like [Bash], [zsh], and [fish].

## Continuous integration \{#ci}

You learned about [Nix development environments][env] earlier in the quick start.
Because Nix development environments are both cross platform and fully [reproducible][reproducibility], they're quite useful in [continuous integration][ci] environments.
