title: Uninstall Nix (if necessary)
order: 7
summary: ["Cleanly remove Nix from your system"]
---

At the beginning of the Zero to Nix quick start, we [installed] Nix using the fast and stable [Determinate Nix Installer][nix-installer], from [Determinate Systems][ds].
We hope that your journey with Nix continues well into the future, but if you need to uninstall Nix for any reason you can do so with this command:

```shell
/nix/nix-installer uninstall
```

Follow the prompts to approve the requested changes.
Some of the changes that the installer requests:

- Delete the directory tree under `/nix`
- Delete the [Nix] CLI tool
- Delete all Nix-specific users and groups
- Delete the Nix configuration file at `/etc/nix/nix.conf`

Once the Determinate Nix Installer is done, you can verify that uninstallation has succeeded by confirming that directories like `/nix` and `~/.nix-profile` have been removed from your system:

```shell
ls /nix # error
ls ~/.nix-profile # error
```
